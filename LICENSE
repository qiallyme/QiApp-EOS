QiAlly Commons License v0.1 (Draft)

Personal use and businesses with ≤ $150k annual gross: free

Above threshold or multi-employee teams: paid license (subscription or per-seat)

Redistribution allowed only with license intact; no resale of code itself

Offer Enterprise Add-Ons:

Branded builds and custom manifests

SSO, audit logging, remote config

Priority SLA and onboarding

Private connectors (HoneyBook, Drive SA, Zep2Mail workflows)

Nothing in code changes for this yet; it’s policy. You can add a LICENSE later and a license.json flag in qi.yaml if you want apps to display license status in the UI.

15) Troubleshooting

Double-click script closes instantly: run from PowerShell to see the error. Usually Python not found or blocked by antivirus.

Venv fails to create: ensure py launcher exists (py --version). If not, install Python 3.11 from python.org and re-run.

No popup in QiMini: PySimpleGUI import failed. Check dat/out/result.json for success; then run install-win.bat.

Exporter shows empty: ensure the repo has files beyond ignored dirs, and you ran in the correct folder.

16) Roadmap hooks (already accounted for)

Cockpit handshake via core/hook.py

Stable entrypoints: boot() in main.py, go() in core/run.py

Flat structure: core, ast, dat

React/Vite/Tauri/Electron templates will follow with the same Danger Zone contract and Windows run scripts

Supabase/OpenAI/Gemini/Cloudflare/etc. env slots reserved in .env.example
