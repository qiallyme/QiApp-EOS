# Qi-App EOS Rules (Windows)
1) Folder names are fixed: core, ast, dat.
2) Every app exposes boot() in main.py and go() in core/run.py.
3) qi.yaml must exist and declare entry + outputs.
4) Apps write to ./dat/out by default.
5) Cockpit handshake lives in core/hook.py.
6) Do not rename qi.yaml, main.py, or core/hook.py.
7) No secrets in git. Use .env and .env.example.
8) Code exporter must exclude venv/, node_modules/, dist/, build/, __pycache__/.
